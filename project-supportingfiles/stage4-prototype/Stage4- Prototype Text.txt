My paper prototypes included “Bookstore Original” and “Bookstore Secondary”; both prototypes include a place to create
an account, sign in, and different page layouts for the different roles (managers and employees)

The only difference is the first home page: for “Bookstore Secondary” the sign in and create an account buttons 
for both profiles are on the home page, for “Bookstore Original”, only “create an account” button is on the 
first page and I included another button that takes you to another page to access the sign in page and sign in
