STAGE 2- DEFINE
Create an online system that is accessible via laptop and mobile device that enables bookstore employees to add,
delete, and update books for their inventory. Only managers can add, delete, and update books from the system; 
employees can add and update books. Define the system by categorizing the books by genre, century, author, 
and condition (rate by stars). Information about the books should include availability, condition, location, and price.
