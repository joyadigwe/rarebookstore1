The system should be accessible from a laptp or tablet.
Employees should be able to add, update, and delete books from the system.
Not all employees should be able to delete books from the system.

The Rare Bookstore's clients have indicated that they will require the ability to view a list of their books.
They also want to search through the list to find books based on their price, author's name, and book's title.
They also want to sort list based on genre and condition (rate by stars).
